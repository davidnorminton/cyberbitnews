This first part covers a lot of ground for the initial setup, including Gulp installation and an outline of the tasks we want it to run. If you're interested in how the tasks are created, then stay tuned for part two.\nEarlier this year, I created a course for building premium WordPress themes. During the process, I wanted to use a task runner to concatenate and minify JavaScript and CSS files. I ended up using that task runner to automate a lot of other tasks that made the theme much more efficient and scalable.\nThe two most popular task runners powered by Node are Gulp and Grunt. I went with Gulp after a good amount of research, it appeared to have an intuitive way to write tasks. It uses Node streams to manipulate files and JavaScript functions to write the tasks, whereas Grunt uses a configuration object to define tasks \u2014 which might be fine for some, but is something that made me a little uncomfortable. Also, Gulp is a bit faster that Grunt because of those Node streams and faster is always a good thing to me!\n (more\u2026)\n              ","domain":"css-tricks","wpm":"14.86"},{"id":"38006","title":"19K Orange Livebox Modems Open to Attack","url":"https:\/\/threatpost.com\/19k-orange-livebox-modems-open-to-attack\/140376\/","date":"2018-12-26","image":"https:\/\/media.threatpost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/103\/2018\/08\/20163257\/vulnerability-540x270.png","snippet":"A simple flaw allows attackers to derive WiFi credentials with little effort.","domain":"threatpost","wpm":"1.63"},{"id":"38003","title":"Top 2018 Security and Privacy Stories","url":"https:\/\/threatpost.com\/top-2018-security-and-privacy-stories\/140312\/","date":"2018-12-26","image":"https:\/\/media.threatpost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/103\/2018\/12\/19183445\/Hacker-year-in-review-20182-570x285.jpg","snippet":"The top cybersecurity and privacy trends that biggest impact in 2018.","domain":"threatpost","wpm":"5.53"},{"id":"38001","title":"The Nightmare After Christmas","url":"https:\/\/blog.rapid7.com\/2018\/12\/26\/the-nightmare-_after_-christmas\/","date":"2018-12-26","image":"https:\/\/blog.rapid7.com\/content\/images\/2018\/12\/haxmas-2018-3.jpg","snippet":"With all the incidents that occurred in 2018, you may feel a bit like a CISO Scrooge.
